What is Community of Banks  project ?

Currently banks are spending lot of time and effort in collecting documents from customer and verifying the same with authenticated 3rd party. Customers at the same hand have to go through same process of providing documents again and again for different banks even though their documents are verified by an authenticated  3rd party in a bank.

Community of Banks is a concept to form consortium of banks on legal terms and condition to share the customer documents and verification details with other authenticated bank in the community to save effort and cost of verification and document collection.

How the Community of banks concept should work ?

Community of bank is meant to allow authenticated banks within a community to search for a prospect details and check if he /she is already a customer with other bank . His documents can be reused by the applicant bank and also if the bank is willing they can choose to reuse the  verification done a authenticated 3rd party for previous bank.
This solution can be  expanded to large scale landscape where customerâ€™s documents can be shared through a secure channel among the members of community.
When a customer is onboarded in any bank , a consent can be taken for that customer if his documents can be shared with other banks for any of his engagement with them in future.
